# Account-create-intro

This is a 'Create Account Intro' page developed using HTML5, raw CSS, and pure JavaScript. Client-side validation has been implemented to provide real-time feedback on input errors or incorrect formats. Additionally, media queries have been utilized to ensure the page is mobile-friendly.

Below are the featured that I used:

🧑‍💻 HTML5 Features:

Semantic Elements: Use of <main>, <form>, and structured <div> elements for better organization and readability.

Enhanced Form Controls:
<input type="email"> for email validation.
<input type="password"> with guidelines for secure passwords.

External Resource Linking: Integration of Google Fonts and Font Awesome via <link> for enhanced typography and icons.

Client-Side Form Validation: Attributes like type="email" and associated error messages for immediate user feedbacked error messages for immediate user feedback.
